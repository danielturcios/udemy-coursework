Percentages
- Percentages are always relative to some other value
    - Sometimes, it's a value from the parent and other times it's a value from the element itself
    - E.g.: width: 50% = half the width of the parent
    - E.g.: line-height: 50% = half the font-size of the element itself

EM
- EM's are relative units
    - With font-size, 1em equals the font-size of the parent. 2em's is twice the font-siz of the parent, etc.
    - With other properties, 1em is equal to the computed font-size of the element itself.
